Synopsis

Build a javascript running through different arrays containing different 'positive' words. the return value is send to a location on page.
This is what the word generator is about. I added php to allow the words to be sent onto user of choice. Used flexbox as css.
Keeping the product on one side of the page and allowing for extra details - rows - on the other side of the page. Note that the email validator is not mine. References of creator included in JS file.

Motivation

Solo project at the New York Code and Design Academy in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 
The scope of the project was to create a web site and apply as many things as we could. 
In this scenario I used HTML, CSS, JS, PHP.


ERROR PAGES

The site contains 2 php pages. the first page is the error page. This one can be accessed on contact-form-handler.php. It can be completely customized. The second page is in actual fact just an empty HTML, with no style, throwing the Thank Alert and sending visitors back to the index page.
